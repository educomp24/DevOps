Docker Stacks: 
Services are capable of running single repicated application across nodes in the cluster, but what if you need to deploy a more complex application consisting of multiple services ?

A Stack is a collection of interrelated services that can be deployed and sclaed as a unit. 
===================================================================================================

create services in swarm using compose file ( declarative model )

        docker stack deploy -c compose.yml mystack
        docker stack ls
        docker stack ps mystack
        docker stack services mystack
        docker stack rm mystack
        docker service scale mysvc=3
        
        
        Example - 
        
        version: "3"
services:
  app:
    # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
    image: nareshmnvs/myapp:latest
    deploy:
      replicas: 5
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.5"
          memory: 150M
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  web:
    # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
    image: nareshmnvs/nginx:v1
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.1"
          memory: 50M
    ports:
      - "8090:80"
