Docker Content Trust (DCT):
===========================
Docker Content Trust (DCT) provides a secure way to verify the integrity of images before you pull or run them on your systems.

With DCT, the image creator signs each image with a certificate, which clients can use to verify the image before running it.
	docker trust key genereate <signer name>

Genereate a delegation key pair. This gives users access to sing images for a repository.
	docker trust signer add --key <key file> <signer name> <repo>  -- add a signer to a repo
	docker trust sign <repo>:<tag>  --- Sign an image and push it to the repository.
	
Enablling DCT:
==============
Docker Content Trust can be enabled by setting the DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST environment variable to 1.

In Docker Enterprise Edition, we can also enable it in daemon.json

When DIT is enabled, Docker will only pull and run signed images, Attempting to pull and/or run an unsigned image will result in an error message.

Note that when
DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1, docker push will automatically sign the image before pushing it. 

we can disable the Docker Content Trust by setting DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST environment variable to 0.
