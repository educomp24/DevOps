PUPPET MASTER:
puppet master is a service runs a the centralized or main server which used to manage the entier clients to deploy, configure and maintains the infrastructure.

PUPPET AGENT:
puppet agent is a service that run on the client which sends the request to master & gets the catalog of changes from master and applies them on server where it is running. it finds any resource that is not in their desired state & makes changes as neccessary to correct them. after applying the catalog the agent submits a report to the puppet master.

CATALOG:
a catalog is a document that describes the desired system state for one specific server. it lists all the resources that need to be managed as well as dependencies between those resources.

MANIFESTS:
manifests are files with extension ".pp" where we declare all resources to be checked or to be changed. resources may be files, packages, services etc....

what are puppet modules ? why do we need puppet modules ?
A module is a collection of manifests and data ( such as facts, files, and templates ), and they have a specific directory structure. Modules are useful for organizing your puppet code, because they allow you to split your code into multiple manifests. it is considered the best practice to use modules to organize almost all of your puppet manifests.

Useful paths:-
/var/log/puppet contains logs (but also on normal syslog files, with facility daemon), both for agents and master

/var/lib/puppet contains Puppet operational data (catalog, certs, backup of files...)

/var/lib/puppet/ssl contains SSL certificate

/var/lib/puppet/clientbucket contains backup copies of the files changed by Puppet

/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp (On Master) The first manifest that the master parses when a client connects in order to produce the configuration to apply to it (Default on Puppet < 3.6 where are used config-file environments)

/etc/puppet/environments/production/manifests/site.pp (On Master) The first manifest that the master parses when using directory environments (recommended from Puppet 3.6 and default on Puppt >= 4)

/etc/puppet/modules and /usr/share/puppet/modules (On Master) The default directories where modules are searched

/etc/puppet/environments/production/modules (On Master) An extra place where modules are looked for when using directory environments

/var/lib/puppet/reports -- To see the reports reported by nodes
