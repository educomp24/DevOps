	3) ansible uses SSH protocol to communicate with remote servers
	
	4) ansible uses below methods for remote servers authentication

Ansible controller ( is the machine/host/server where we install ansible ) 

	/etc/ansible default directory ( we have two important file in it )
	
		hosts ( default inventory file in which we can mention remote servers we want to apply/push the changes to)
